# NetApp IoT Hackathon
Resources and Sources for an IoT Hackathon with an Arduino Based ESP8266 WeMos D1 mini board, myStrom WLAN Power Outlet, Adafruit MQTT and IFTTT.

The goal of this Hackathon is to get familiar with different technologies and build a basic IoT Use Case. You'll start with some basic steps, setup the IDE, hardware environment and run some basic programs. After that, you'll expand your local setup and make it communicating with Adafruit's IoT Platform using MQTT. The next step is to link Adafruit with "If this then that" (IFTTT) in order to get access to the bright IoT Space and control or trigger further events. The following picture gives you a high-level overview about what you're going to build.
