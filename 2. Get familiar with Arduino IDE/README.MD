# Load your first Sketch
Arduino IDE ships with many example projects in order to help you to get started.

1. Click on "File" - "Examples" - "01.Basics" and select the "Blink" Sketch. This will open a simple code which, once deployed, will blink the onboard LED on your WeMos board.

Have a look at the code to understand how it is structured.

2. Click on "Verify" in order to check your code.
