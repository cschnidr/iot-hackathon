# Load the new project
This chapter will be interesting because you'll build a specific use case. Your WeMos will be connected to the Internet and publish sensor data to an IoT Platform. The following things need to be setup in order to do that.

1. Create an Adafruit Account
2. Connect your Door-Sensor
3. Create a new Project in your Adafruit IDE
4. Join your WeMos to your WLAN
5. Configure Feeds send & receive messages
6. Provide your API Key in the Sketch


# Create an Adafruit Account
Visit the Adafruit Website and create a free account https://io.adafruit.com/. Adafruit provides a free or charge IoT Service to get started easily with your project. To send and receive data between Adafruit and your WeMos it's best to define dedicated Feeds. It's not mandatory but it makes sense because we're having two different use cases (send sensor data to Adafruit and receiving data to control your Wireless Switch). To so so Click on "Feeds" => "Acions" => and "Create a New Feed".
