# Create your IFTTT Recipe
IFTTT provides input conditions e.g. based on geolocation of your phone, sunset / sunrise at a defined location and so on. This could be used for example to turn on your WiFi Switch with a lamp when the sun goes down and turn it off at a specific time.

The second reciept could be a push notification to your phone, once the door sensor is opened or closed.
